<div class="entry-content"><p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve read a lot about the value of doing reflection and self-diagnosis to constantly strive for self-improvement. I wanted to experiment a little, and the first step is to get some of my thoughts down right now so I can analyze them in the future. In this post, I&rsquo;ll be doing a reflection of the last four months of my life (2F EngSci). Specifically, I want to focus on how I dramatically changed my attitude towards education and how it&rsquo;s paid off, as well as how I was able to land a summer internship at Microsoft in software engineering.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Let&rsquo;s start with school. Before this school year began, I had already decided that the attitude I had last year was toxic &ndash; caring more about my grades than understanding the material. That in itself could be an entire blog post, but I&rsquo;ll focus instead on how I changed that attitude and the results I saw from it.</p>

<p>First off, I resolved to maintain a positive attitude towards learning this year. I strongly believe in the idea that if you keep telling yourself something, you will believe it. The thing that I told myself was: I&rsquo;m not going to worry about my grades, but I will try to truly understand everything that I am being taught. This is harder than it sounds, because I, like most people I know, have been conditioned my entire life to get good grades so that I could get into a good university and get a good job. Adopting this strategy, I attended 95%+ of my classes, as opposed to last school year when I attended about 70%, while feeling less stressed out, almost never cramming and scoring ~7% better on my overall average compared to 1W.</p>

<p>Something that I tried that was a little more unconventional was living without Wifi this last semester &ndash; the only form of internet I had at home was my 6 GB of mobile data. I was actually quite happy with this decision even though people I spoke to found it appalling. I have come to appreciate that seemingly unlimited wireless internet is not necessary, in fact, I was able to do all the important things in my life while remaining under this 6GB limit, going over only when I chose to do time-wasting things like watch Youtube videos for a few hours. In fact, I believe in this so strongly that I will return to school in 2W with the same 6GB of internet per month.</p>

<p>Next I will talk about finding a job. To me, getting a job is a two-step process. The first step is getting in the door &ndash; getting an interview &ndash; while the second step is convincing the company that you should be hired. In regards to the first step, I found that my chances were significantly higher when I was able to meet with a recruiter face-to-face. Out of the 6 companies that I met with in real life, 3 of them interviewed me. This is in contrast to the 9 companies that I applied to online, all of which either rejected me or did not respond to me. This leads me into my second lesson learned &ndash; pitching. Now I am by no means an expert in the art of pitching, quite the contrary actually, but I tried something unconventional that worked: I went around career fairs and events with my <a href="http://ringocheung.pythonanywhere.com/ExpenSe/">app</a> opened on my tablet and started my conversation with recruiters talking about the app. For resumes, I recommend <a href="http://www.thegoogleresume.com/">The Google Resume</a>, I learned most of my resume knowledge there. My resume is on the blog <a href="http://ringocheung.github.io/RingoCheungResume.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>For the second step, I recommend for those looking at software positions (but to be honest any position will be similar because you will be problem solving) to practice problem solving. Engineering students are fortunate here because they hone their problem solving skills in their day to day studies. Regardless, you should be practicing for your interviews. I put in around 40 hours preparing for interviews this semester. Not only did it help me land a job, but it also renewed my passion for problem solving. Another important note is that it is not about getting the correct answer in interviews. In fact, at my final round interviews for Microsoft, I did not answer all the questions correctly (to be honest, I answered embarrassingly few of them correctly), but I was stil able to land the job because I really focussed on communicating my problem solving process clearly, and articulating my passion for software engineering and problem solving. I recommend the book <a href="http://www.careercup.com/book">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> for practicing for software interviews &ndash; it certainly worked for me.</p>
